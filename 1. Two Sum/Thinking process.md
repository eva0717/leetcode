<h2>The first thought</h2>
<p>First I think that it's hard to find a pair of number that is satisfy the target.</p>
<p>So I think maybe I could use the things like pointer, to check them one by one?</p>
<p>But it may take O(n^2) time commplexity to do. Maybe I should try something else?</p>
<p>I decided to write this first, and find other better way after AC.</p>
